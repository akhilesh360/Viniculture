## Project Overview
Analyze the **Wine Quality** dataset to:
- Conduct EDA on red and white wine samples
- Visualize relationships between chemical properties and quality scores
- Engineer and select features for improved model performance
- Train and evaluate classification and regression algorithms for quality prediction

Insights guide winemakers and consumers by highlighting key quality determinants.

## Dataset
- **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository
- **Files:**
  - `winequality-red.csv`
  - `winequality-white.csv`
- **Features:** 11 physicochemical attributes (e.g., `fixed acidity`, `pH`, `alcohol`) and quality score (0â€“10)

## Exploratory Data Analysis
- Compare quality score distributions for red vs. white wines
- Generate correlation heatmaps to identify significant feature interactions
- Use scatter plots and boxplots to detect outliers and examine feature distributions

## Feature Engineering
- Combine red and white datasets with a source indicator
- Bin quality scores into categorical labels (low, medium, high)
- Scale and normalize continuous variables
- Create interaction terms where statistical analysis indicates potential synergy

## Modeling & Evaluation
- **Algorithms:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Elastic Net Regression
- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Classification: Accuracy, F1-score, ROC AUC
  - Regression: R<sup>2</sup>, RMSE
- **Validation Strategy:** Stratified k-fold cross-validation for classification; k-fold for regression

## Notebook
All code and analysis reside in `Viniculture.ipynb`, organized into:
1. Data Loading & Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Training & Hyperparameter Tuning
5. Model Evaluation & Visualization
